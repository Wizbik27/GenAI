**High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) for Multi-Agent Workflow Assignment**

---

### **High-Level Design (HLD)**

#### **Objective**
To create a multi-agent system for researching a company's industry, generating AI/ML/GenAI use cases, and collecting relevant resources/datasets. The system will follow a modular and scalable architecture to ensure efficiency and reusability.

---

#### **System Architecture Overview**

1. **Input Module**
   - Captures user input (company name).
   - Ensures input validation and proper formatting.

2. **Agents**
   - **Agent 1: Research Agent**
     - Gathers industry-specific information about the company.
   - **Agent 2: Use Case Generator**
     - Analyzes the research results and generates three use cases leveraging AI/ML/GenAI.
   - **Agent 3: Resource Collector**
     - Searches for relevant datasets/resources for the identified use cases.

3. **Processing Layer**
   - Orchestrates the interaction between agents.
   - Handles data flow and intermediate results.

4. **Output Module**
   - Aggregates results from all agents.
   - Saves results in a structured JSON file and prints outputs to the console.

5. **LLM Integration**
   - Uses OpenAI's language model for text generation and analysis within each agent.

6. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - Ensures smooth execution with retry logic and logs errors for debugging.

### **Low-Level Design (LLD)**

#### **Module Details**

1. **Input Module**
   - **Functionality:**
     - Accepts the company name from the user.
     - Validates input to ensure non-empty and valid string.
   - **Methods:**
     - `input("Enter the company name for research: ")`
   - **Error Handling:**
     - Displays a friendly error message if input is invalid.

2. **Agent 1: Research Agent**
   - **Functionality:**
     - Gathers industry information and company focus areas.
     - Uses a language model to generate the response.
   - **Implementation:**
     - `LLMChain` with a prompt template for research.
     - Inputs: `company_name`
     - Output: Research details as a string.
   - **Dependencies:**
     - OpenAI LLM via LangChain.

3. **Agent 2: Use Case Generator**
   - **Functionality:**
     - Analyzes research results to generate three use cases.
     - Suggests AI/ML/GenAI applications relevant to the industry and company.
   - **Implementation:**
     - `LLMChain` with a structured prompt template for use case generation.
     - Inputs: `industry`, `company_name`
     - Output: A list of three use cases.

4. **Agent 3: Resource Collector**
   - **Functionality:**
     - Searches for relevant datasets or resources to support the identified use cases.
   - **Implementation:**
     - `LLMChain` with a structured prompt for resource collection.
     - Inputs: `use_cases`
     - Output: Links to datasets/resources in markdown format.

5. **Output Module**
   - **Functionality:**
     - Aggregates the outputs of all agents.
     - Saves the results in a JSON file.
     - Prints a summary of results to the console.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Python `json` library for file operations.
     - File: `output_results.json`

---

#### **Error Handling & Logging**

1. **Common Errors:**
   - API rate limits or quota issues.
   - Missing or invalid input.
   - LLM failures (e.g., invalid prompt or empty response).

2. **Solutions:**
   - Use `try-except` blocks for API calls and file operations.
   - Implement retries with exponential backoff for API rate limits.
   - Log errors to a file for debugging.

---

#### **Technology Stack**

1. **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
2. **Libraries:**
   - `langchain`: Orchestrates LLM-based workflows.
   - `openai`: For language model integration.
   - `json`: For output file handling.
3. **Execution Environment:**
   - Local Python environment or virtual environment with dependencies installed.

#### **Sequence Diagram**
```
User ---> Input Module: Provide company name
Input Module ---> Research Agent: Initiate research
Research Agent ---> Use Case Agent: Provide industry data
Use Case Agent ---> Resource Agent: Request resources for use cases
Resource Agent ---> Output Module: Return resource links
Output Module ---> User: Display and save results
```

### **Future Enhancements**

1. **Caching:**
   - Cache research results and use cases to reduce repetitive API calls.

2. **Parallel Execution:**
   - Run agents in parallel to reduce overall execution time.

3. **Custom Dataset Search:**
   - Integrate APIs like Kaggle or Hugging Face directly for dataset search.

4. **Dynamic Error Handling:**
   - Add advanced monitoring and recovery mechanisms for API failures.

### **Conclusion**
This design ensures modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance while delivering the required functionality for the multi-agent system.
